## How are SDIs different from other Interviews?
SDIs are involved with a much higher level of abstraction. We need to figure out the requirements and map them to the 
components. Then you need to come with a communication protocol that connects the sub systems.

In SDIs you may be asked about well known problems like design Whatsapp, Youtube, etc. It is not possible to design 
Whatsapp within 30 to 40 mins.

#### Step to flow to gather the requirements
    
1. **Solidify the requirements** - Should ask questions to solidify the requirements.
2. **Scope the requirements** - Need to scope the requirements because we can not design systems like Whatsapp within 
30 to 40 min. 
3. **Engage the Interviewer** - Keep talking to the interviewer to get more information about the problem. 
Communication with the interviewer is key in SDIs.

## How to Prepare for Success

### Ask Why a system works?
1. Learn popular systems like FB, Youtube. Whatsapp works. Ask questions about how it works. 
2. Learn why a particular component is used, for example why MongoDB instead of MtSQL. 
3. Build the project and start from the scratch

### The right directions.
    
    We need to focus more on trade offs instead of internal mechanisms.
It doesn't help much if the discussion is around MSSQL or MySQL Because both are similar. Instead we can have discussed 
where the NoSQL or SQL can make a huge difference.

### Mock Interviews
Mock interviews are good to prepare SDIs. You can take or give SDIs. It give the real time SDIs experience. You can 
evaluate what went wrong and what worked for you.

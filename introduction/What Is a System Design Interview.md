### How are SDIs different from other Interviews?
SDIs are involved with a much higher level of abstraction. We need to figure out the requirements and map them to the 
components. Then you need to come with a communication protocol that connects the sub systems.

In SDIs you may be asked about well known problems like design Whatsapp, Youtube, etc. It is not possible to design 
Whatsapp within 30 to 40 mins.

#### Step to flow to gather the requirements
    
1. **Solidify the requirements** - Should ask questions to solidify the requirements.
2. **Scope the requirements** - Need to scope the requirements because we can not design systems like Whatsapp within 
30 to 40 min. 
3. **Engage the Interviewer** - Keep talking to the interviewer to get more information about the problem. 
Communication with the interviewer is key in SDIs

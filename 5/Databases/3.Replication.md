## Replication
### What is Replication?
In distributed systems achieving scalability, availability and performance is really challenging. Replication is one of 
the ways to achieve this.

Replication is nothing but replicating the same data in multiple nodes to achieve scalability, availability and 
performance. If you have only read operations performing on the data the replication is not complex. But when you have write operations then replication becomes complex.

There are two ways to replicate the data 
1. Synchronous replication 
2. Asynchronous replication.

### Synchronous replication
Primary node waits for the secondary node acknowledgement. After receiving the acknowledgement from all secondary nodes 
the primary node sends acknowledgement to the client.

#### Advantage
System makes sure that the write operation is replicated in all the servers. All secondary servers will be up to date 
and in the same state.

#### Disadvantage
If any one or more secondary servers are failed or facing the latency issue the write operation may take more time due 
to this client may receive acknowledgement with latency or he can assume the write operation is failed due to timeout.

### Asynchronous replication
Primary node sends the acknowledgement to the client once the data persisted in the primary server locally. It doesn't 
wait for the secondary node acknowledgement. Once the acknowledgement is sent to the primary node then the primary node 
tries to replicate the data in all secondary nodes.

#### Advantage
Clients will get a quicker response from the primary server. Primary servers can not be affected due to secondary servers.

#### Disadvantage
If the primary node fails the unreplicated date will be lost.

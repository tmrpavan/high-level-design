## Domain Name System

### What is a Domain System?
Every system which is connected to the network has an IP address. If you want to access any resource from a particular 
server you need the IP address of that server.

Remembering the IP address of the servers is not an easy job for humans that is why we created domain names. Domain 
names are mapped to specific IP addresses. Domain names are human readable and easy to remember.

We have Domain names which are mapped to a specific IP address. How is going to maintain this mapping? How to get the 
IP address of specific Domain? DNS does all of this for you.

#### DNS
DNS stands for Domain Name system. DNS responsible for storing the Domain mapping and you can also get the IP address 
of a domain from DNS.

When a user requests a Domain form the Browser. Browser requests DNS to provide IP address of that Domain name. Once a 
List of IP addresses is received to the browser then the browser makes a request to the server using anyone of the IP 
which is received from the browser.

#### Important Details of DNS.
**Name servers** 
1. DNS is not a single system which is a complex system of multiple small components. Users can query the 
Name server to get the details of the particular domain.

**Resource Record**
1. DNS store the Domain and mapping in the form of Resource Record (RR). There are multiple types of Resource Record.

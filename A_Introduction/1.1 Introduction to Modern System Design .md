## Introduction to Modern System Design

#### What is System design?
**System design** is a process to build large scale systems by defining Components and their Integration and APIs and Data 
modelling that full fill the functional and non-functional requirements.

System design uses the concepts of **distributed system**, **parallel computing** and **computer networking** to create a highly 
scalable system. Distributed systems are highly scalable and complex to design. System Design reduces the complexity of 
building this kind of system.

System design aims to build systems that are **Reliable**, **Effective** and **Maintainable** Systems.
    
    Reliable Systems can handle faults, errors and failures.
    Effective Systems meet the needs of the user and requirements.
    The Maintainability System can be easily scalable up and down and new features can be added to the system.
